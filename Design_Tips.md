# Dr. Miller's Tips on Visual Communication
## Research
- Visual communication = skill-centered + rhetorical
- Needs to look professional, not necessarily pretty
- Written and visual communication go hand-in-hand
## Rhetoric (Persuading People)
- Branding - creating associations between symbols and your product/service
> 1. Single font
> 2. Single color
> 3. Tagline / summary
> 4. No templates (avoid pre-installed templates; try to find online templates)
- Usability - Make it easy to read.
- Chewbacca - Images often have more persuasive appeal than words.
## Principles
- Contrast - Favor strong color and size contrast over weak contrast. Slight contrasts create mental fuzz in the reader.
- Size - Make headers and body text consistent with one another.
- Proximity - Distance can serve as a type of border.
- Alignment - When in doubt, opt for left alignment.
- Elimination - Use size and proximity instead of dividing lines and borders.
## Practice
- **Support the meaning of the text.**
-**Eliminate mental clutter.**
