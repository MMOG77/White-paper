# Editing v. Revising

- Editing - proofreading
- Revising - plan to holistically restructure the work
***
- Fresh start - not *always* necessary
- Fresh eyes - always helpful
> 1. Find a way to see it differently.
> 2. Use peer review.
> 3. Read it aloud.
- Paramedic Method
- "It's not a quick process." ~~ Dr. Miller
- Harris's 4 Pillars of Revision
> 1. Coming to terms &mdash; becoming self-aware of what the project is; reverse outlining; creating an abstract
> 2. Forwarding &mdash; building on the documents' strengths; primacy-recency
> 3. Countering &mdash; filling gaps
> 4. Looking Ahead &mdash; concluding ideas; call to action; Where do I (the author) go from here (this project)?
