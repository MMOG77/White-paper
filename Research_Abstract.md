# Research Abstract

For my white paper, I plan to write something on the topic of bilingual education. A 1996 article, appropriately titled "[Debate Over Bilingualism](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1996011900)," can help me provide a historical backdrop to the modern issue of language integration. Google Scholar has an electronic copy of [Foundations of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HAwxBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=bilingual&ots=Tbx52N2jdL&sig=KFtW1OHI_JZrrVnIn7YmEdrtdds#v=onepage&q=bilingual&f=false) that will probably end up becoming by one big source (or at least a major source). The American Federation of teachers has a [think piece](https://www.aft.org/ae/fall2015/goldenberg_wagner) about the issue, and I can add ethos to the project with opinions from an organization that specializes in education.
