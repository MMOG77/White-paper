# Research Abstract

For my white paper, I plan to write something on the topic of bilingual education. A 1996 **CQ Researcher** article, appropriately titled "[Debate Over Bilingualism](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1996011900)," can help me provide a historical backdrop to the modern issue of language integration. **Google Scholar** has an electronic copy of [Foundations of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HAwxBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=bilingual&ots=Tbx52N2jdL&sig=KFtW1OHI_JZrrVnIn7YmEdrtdds#v=onepage&q=bilingual&f=false) that will probably end up becoming by one big source (or at least a major source). The **American Federation of Teachers** has a [think piece](https://www.aft.org/ae/fall2015/goldenberg_wagner) about the issue, and I can add ethos to the project with opinions from an organization that specializes in education. Throughout the paper, I plan to consult the **[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages](https://www.actfl.org/advocacy/what-the-research-shows). The Guardian**, which was a staple for my blog research, is also likely to make an [appearance](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/04/what-happens-to-the-brain-language-learning). I even found the Wikipedia article on bilingual education. Instead of using Wikipedia itself, however, I plan to co-opt some of their sources: the **U.S. Department of Education's** [Office of English Language Acquisition](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oela/index.html), the **[National Clearninghouse for English Language Acquisition](https://web.archive.org/web/20131113145910/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/)**, and **[ASCD.org](http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx)**. I definitely know which topic I want to explore, but I have not found the right angle yet. Hopefully something will come to me over Thanksgiving break.
