# Research Abstract

For my white paper, I plan to write something on the topic of bilingual education. A 1996 article, appropriately titled "[Debate Over Bilingualism](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1996011900)," can help me provide a historical backdrop to the modern issue of language integration. Google Scholar has an electronic copy of [Foundations of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HAwxBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=bilingual&ots=Tbx52N2jdL&sig=KFtW1OHI_JZrrVnIn7YmEdrtdds#v=onepage&q=bilingual&f=false) that will probably end up becoming by one big source (or at least a major source). The American Federation of teachers has a [think piece](https://www.aft.org/ae/fall2015/goldenberg_wagner) about the issue, and I can add ethos to the project with opinions from an organization that specializes in education. Throughout the paper, I plan to consult the [American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages](https://www.actfl.org/advocacy/what-the-research-shows). The Guardian, which was a staple for my blog research, is also likely to make an [appearance](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/04/what-happens-to-the-brain-language-learning).

Clearly, I know which topic I want to explore, but I have not found the right angle yet.
