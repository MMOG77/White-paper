# Research Abstract

For my white paper, I plan to write something on the topic of bilingual education. A 1996 article, appropriately titled "[Debate Over Bilingualism](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1996011900)," can help me provide a historical backdrop to the modern issue of language integration.
