# Topic Commitment

For my white paper, I want to tackle the issue of bilingual education (as is probably obvious from my research abstract). The debate on the issue is whether or not to accommodate non-native speakers of English with lessons in both English **and** their respective mother tongues. I would like to propose a compromise: a buddy system in which a select group of native English speakers take lessons in the non-natives' languages (through summer courses) to become peer tutors and study partners to ESL kids.
